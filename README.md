# Personal_Income_Tax_Calculator
We will write a program that calculates the personal income tax based on the given tax rates reported by the Turkish Revenue Administration. The tax  rates vary every year.
We will ask the user for:

     - The year of the income (year) (2017-2020)
     - The amount of income (income)
We will calculate and output:

	   - The amount of income (income)
	   - The tax amount (tax)
	   - The income after tax (newIncome)
	   - The real tax rate (taxRate)
